                    <h2>MOHAMMAD SHUHAIB B A</h2>
                    <p>My name is Mohammad Shuhaib B A.I am a 2023 graduate with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Visvesvaraya technological University. My academic background, internship experiences, and passion for problem-solving make me eager to contribute to your team.<br>

                        During my studies, I gained a strong foundation in software development, data analysis, and web technologies. I am proficient in programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, MySql and have hands-on experience with frameworks like Spring Boot and also I am proficient in buisness tools like Excel, Tableau, R Programming. I have used tools like Eclipse IDE, Visual Studio,Tableau Public and Excel. I am proficient in languages like English, Malayalam, Hindi. My final year project, Bearys Online Exchange which is an android based mobile  application, involved developing a fully functional E-commerce application by using android studio and Java as a coding tool and we implemented user authentication and it is mainly for  college students to sell, exchange, buy, rent their used products, which further honed my skills in collaborative teamwork.<br>
